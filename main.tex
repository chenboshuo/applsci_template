\documentclass[journal,article,submit,pdftex,moreauthors]{settings/mdpi}
% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, 
% you may use "preprints" as the journal and 
% change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, 
% e.g., 
% \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.
